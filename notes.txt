What causes the header to not get jquery styles?
    1- jquery mobile still trying to handle paging
    2- $.mobilechangepage was called before view was created (callback didn't finish)

This fixed a page:
                this.$el.page();
                this.$el.trigger('pagecreate');
                $('#the_list').listview().listview('refresh');

done:
challenge view: showing same challenge every time
                show leaderboard
update challenge progress
update activities

use fitbit subscription for updates!
subscribe to fitbit from js

auto update collection views when changed:
and use backbone collections for:
invitations
challenges

switch from one-to-many relationship to querying

fixed? - accept/decline invitation - error?

challenge created without invites?  no popup?

done-ish:
use momentJS for date displays

todo minimum viable product:

mark activity rows as final
complete challenge, declare winner
notify users

get activities after creating a challenge or after joining

update any past activity days that are missing and needed for a challenge
cron job - create any missing invites for a challenge

bug - return from fitbit auth - cant read login info?

add back button
add refresh button


todo v.next:
use stackmob login system
change ensure login to handle redirect to login and back to destination

longpoll or check for updates to leaderboards


bugs:
login failed with invalid email password, then later failed with same credentials
