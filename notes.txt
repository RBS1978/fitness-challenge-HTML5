fitness challenge:

What causes the header to not get jquery styles?
    1- jquery mobile still trying to handle paging
    2- $.mobilechangepage was called before view was created (callback didn't finish)

This fixed a page:
                this.$el.page();
                this.$el.trigger('pagecreate');
                $('#the_list').listview().listview('refresh');

done:
challenge view: showing same challenge every time
                show leaderboard
